#### 0x01 Dijkstra

把别人的[算法](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/)粘过来，不知道什么时候会用上吧

```Python
# Python program for Dijkstra's single 
# source shortest path algorithm. The program is 
# for adjacency matrix representation of the graph 

# Library for INT_MAX

					for row in range(vertices)]

		print "Vertex tDistance from Source"
		for node in range(self.V): 
			print node,"t",dist[node]

	# minimum distance value, from the set of vertices 
	# not yet included in shortest path tree 
	def minDistance(self, dist, sptSet): 

		# Initilaize minimum distance for next node 
		min = sys.maxint

			if dist[v] < min and sptSet[v] == False: 
				min = dist[v]

	# shortest path algorithm for a graph represented 
	# using adjacency matrix representation
